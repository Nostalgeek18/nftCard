## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

This project obviously helped to have a better understanding of flexbox. I also add the opportunity to use some pseudo elements by my own for the first time. Which I was glad to found that it was easier than I expected.

### Continued development

Still too many trials and errors over some flexbox. I might wanna try to do this project later on but with grids.

### Useful resources

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiirUiWslI&ab_channel=KevinPowell - This helped me for pseudo elements. Kyle's video on Web Dev Simplified was also helpful as well.
